#DISCLAIMER

Not all resources found in here were mine.
Most of the ones I created can be found in the effects folder. (shaders)

To see were I got the other resources from, 
I always included a ReadMe file containing the url to where I got the resource from.

For example if you want to get the Outset Island textures, you can find that information in 
*Resources/Textures/OutsetIsland/ReadMe.txt*

Credits to the one that published/ripped the resources are also given in that file.
