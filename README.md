# The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker Remake
In context of the course Graphics Programming 2, I received the opportunity to recreate any game of choice. 
To get a head start all students received a base engine called the Overlord Engine. 
This engine, however, lacked a lot of graphical functionalities which I had to implement myself.

This project tries to recreate some elements of Outset island of the game 
"The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker" by implementing graphics programming techniques in c++. 


# How to make it work

Be sure to run  **Set-GP2_LIBS-EnvVariable.bat** before building the project.
This can be found in the GP2_Libraries folder

Afterwards you can simply open the .sln file, select the Overlord project as main project and build.

# Copy right
As this simply is a remake for educational purposes, copyright of the assets still belong to Nintendo.
The base of the Overlord Engine was given by Digital arts and Entertainment for the course Graphics programming

Most assets used in this project were found online. If you go to *TheWindWakerRemake/OverlordProject/Resources* I tried to mention and give credits too the creator or the person that ripped the asset, accompanied with a link of where I got them from.
