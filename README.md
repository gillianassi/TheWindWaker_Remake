# The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker Remake
In context of the course Graphics Programming 2, I received the opportunity to recreate any game of choice. 
To get a head start all students received a base engine called the Overlord Engine. 
This engine, however, lacked a lot of graphical functionalities which I had to implement myself.

This project tries to recreate some elements of Outset island of the game 
"The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker" by implementing graphics programming techniques in c++. 


# How to make it work

Be sure to run  *Set-GP2_LIBS-EnvVariable.bat* before building the project.
This can be found in the GP2_Libraries folder

# Copy right
As this simply is a remake for educational purposes, copyright of the assets still belong to Nintendo.
The base of the Overlord Engine was given by Digital arts and Entertainment for the course Graphics programming
